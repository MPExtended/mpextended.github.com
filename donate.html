   <p>
      Over the time MPExtended has evolved from a simple webservice to a full solution for remote media access, on which we have spent countless hours of development time. As we need to pay for 
      rent and food too, we need donations to spend more time on MPExtended, delivering new features and bugfixes even faster. All donations are highly appreciated.
   </p>

   <p>
      Our standard way to donate is with PayPal. If you want to sponsor a specific feature or donate through another means, please contact 
      <a href="http://forum.team-mediaportal.com/members/oxan.97484/">me</a> on the MediaPortal forums.
